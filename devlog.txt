- Only show active classes
- Fix OAuth2 errors
- Preliminary design doc

emilyZ -- 2020-06-04 23:00
- Add modified design doc

kevinL -- 2020-06-05 08:50
- Unit testing with pytest, not much can be tested since most of the app relies
  OAuth2 though

kevinL -- 2020-06-05 17:12
- Rudimentary single class page
- Moved some code to utl module

kevinL -- 2020-06-06 11:28
- Looks like class rosters can't be shown due to a bug in the API
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43472767/google-classroom-not-returning-classmates-even-with-permission
- Add 411 on Google Calendar API
- Get Google Calendar events of user's classes
  - Need to learn how to send a batch request, atm sending 10 separate requests is rather slow...
- Show events in the form of a table (not a calendar)

kevinL -- 2020-06-06 17:43
- Show assignments and announcements on course page
- Should probably just use classes rather than dealing with multiple dictionaries at once

kevinL -- 2020-06-07 19:07
- Jeez the Classroom API is lacking - there is no way of retrieving/making comments off posts, private or otherwise!
  - https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36882823
- Switch to using classes for posts/announcements to make it easier to distinguish between them

henryL -- 2020-06-08 11:14
- Begin work on search functionality

williamL -- 2020-06-08: 13:14
- added a database for storing hidden classes

kevinL -- 2020-06-08 19:57
- Styling for individual posts on class page

kevinL -- 2020-06-08 20:46
- Noting a bunch of "unfixable" stuff due to the API:
  - The timestamps are always 4 hours behind. I'm not sure if there's a simple way to fix
    this considering it's direct from the API...
  - Some classes use a "scheduled" work rollout feature (case in point, my AP mando class).
    - There's supposed to be a corresponding "scheduledTime" key in those cases, but it's always absent! API why.
    - That breaks the date sorting mechanism for posts (which uses the time when the post was initially made, which could be more than a month back!)
    - Lesser of two evils: use it for classes that don't use scheduled rollout (which is every single one of my classes but AP mando)
- Some more minor post fixes
- Click on posts to show more/less details to cut down on space usage

kevinL -- 2020-06-09 09:41
- Added hide class button (hide function still pending)
- Do not have necessary perms to actually leave/join classes :p
- Show archived courses

kevinL -- 2020-06-09 12:13
- Allow hiding/unhiding (still rough around the edges but will have to do)
