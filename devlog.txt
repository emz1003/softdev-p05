- Created design doc and added needed files and directories.

emilyZ -- 2020-06-01 13:18
- Added team flag

kevinL -- 2020-06-01 13:24
- README
  - Link to the API used
  - Launch codes

kevinL -- 2020-06-01 17:27
- Code that pulls data from your GClass account as a proof of concept

kevinL -- 2020-06-03 22:04
- Stay logged in with Google, also logout button
- Basic navbar

kevinL -- 2020-06-04 09:00
- Created a GitHub Actions workflow, moving it out though to avoid
  perpetually running Flask app

kevinL -- 2020-06-04 14:00
- Only show active classes
- Fix OAuth2 errors
- Preliminary design doc

emilyZ -- 2020-06-04 23:00
- Add modified design doc

kevinL -- 2020-06-05 08:50
- Unit testing with pytest, not much can be tested since most of the app relies
  OAuth2 though

kevinL -- 2020-06-05 17:12
- Rudimentary single class page
- Moved some code to utl module

kevinL -- 2020-06-06 11:28
- Looks like class rosters can't be shown due to a bug in the API
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43472767/google-classroom-not-returning-classmates-even-with-permission
- Add 411 on Google Calendar API
- Get Google Calendar events of user's classes
  - Need to learn how to send a batch request, atm sending 10 separate requests is rather slow...
- Show events in the form of a table (not a calendar)

kevinL -- 2020-06-06 17:43
- Show assignments and announcements on course page
- Should probably just use classes rather than dealing with multiple dictionaries at once

henryL -- 2020-06-06 18:43
- Added dropdown search
- Need to figure out how to look using specific keywords

kevinL -- 2020-06-07 19:07
- Jeez the Classroom API is lacking - there is no way of retrieving/making comments off posts, private or otherwise!
  - https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36882823
- Switch to using classes for posts/announcements to make it easier to distinguish between them

henryL -- 2020-06-08 11:14
- Begin work on search functionality
- Found a nice dropdown search box

williamL -- 2020-06-08: 13:14
- Added a database for storing hidden classes

kevinL -- 2020-06-08 19:57
- Styling for individual posts on class page

kevinL -- 2020-06-08 20:46
- Noting a bunch of "unfixable" stuff due to the API:
  - The timestamps are always 4 hours behind. I'm not sure if there's a simple way to fix
    this considering it's direct from the API...
  - Some classes use a "scheduled" work rollout feature (case in point, my AP mando class).
    - There's supposed to be a corresponding "scheduledTime" key in those cases, but it's always absent! API why.
    - That breaks the date sorting mechanism for posts (which uses the time when the post was initially made, which could be more than a month back!)
    - Lesser of two evils: use it for classes that don't use scheduled rollout (which is every single one of my classes but AP mando)
- Some more minor post fixes
- Click on posts to show more/less details to cut down on space usage

kevinL -- 2020-06-09 09:41
- Added hide class button (hide function still pending)
- Do not have necessary perms to actually leave/join classes :p
- Show archived courses

henryL -- 2020-06-09 09:42
- Text and description now can be searched

henryL -- 2020-06-09 11:42
- Title can now can be searched
- Figured out how to store ids
- Search function complete

henryL -- 2020-06-09 12:38
- Edge case where there are no assignments
- Started work on to do list

kevinL -- 2020-06-09 12:13
- Allow hiding/unhiding (still rough around the edges but will have to do)

henryL -- 2020-06-09 1:28
- Found out how to only have active courses showing
- Worked on times and comparing times stamps
- Format is good now
- Should make to do list more accurate based on time

williamL - 2020-06-09 16:56
- Figured out how to import google calendar
- For some reason, it works on the testing page but not when I pass the
  link through python and jinja. I even double checked and the link is
  the same for both. The only difference is that the test link is a direct
  link whereas the actual page uses a variabel to store the link

henryL -- 2020-06-09 18:48
- To Do list is more accurate now, and things due on the same day that
 have already passed will not show up in the to do list

kevinL -- 2020-06-09 22:14
- Design doc changes
  - Site map more closely resembles current routes
  - (Sadly) have to cut down the stuff that requires "write" access to the APIs
    - Those perms cannot be obtained without our app being verified by Google.
  - Update description accordingly

kevinL -- 2020-06-10 10:23
- Successfully deployed to Flask
  - Biggest note: os.environ variables should be set in .wsgi file, not in __init__.py
  - Needed to do this to get the OAuth2 mechanism working, otherwise it screams at me for HTTPS
